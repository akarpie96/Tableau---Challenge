# Citi Bike Data Presentation - Tableau 
## Phenomonen #1: Peak Hours During  

Peak Hours during Winter appear to be 1-6pm. Peak hours during Summer appear to be 6-7pm. The reason for the Sumemr peak hours could be that people are prone to renting Citi Bikes in the evenings when it's cooler, avoiding the high temperatures/humidity during the day.

##Phenomenon #2: Gender Gap for Subscribers and Customers 

Gap in gender ridership among both Subscribers and Customers indicates little effectiveness in outreach to decrease gap. When filtered for "Customers" the gap does not appear to be as large amongst male and female riders. Customers are both "24 hour" and "3 day" pass riders, and are more likely to be tourists than residents or every day commuters. The reason for this phenomen could potentially be that most tourists are couples traveling together, so the count of customers (both male and female) would in turn grow or decrease at the same rate.
